        <li>Clear room in the center of the pan and in that space add onions, garlic, thyme and escallion. Saute, then mix it in with the beef.
        </li>
        <li>Pour two cups of water into the meat mixture then season it with salt, black pepper, beef bouillon, allspice, paprika, and scotch bonnet pepper then mix. After add ketchup, browning and hoisin sauce. </li>
        <li>Once the meat mixture is boiling lower the heat and let it simmer until the liquid has been transformed into a thick sauce. Then proceed to add in breadcrumbs stirring it in util is evenly dispearsed throughout the mixture. </li>

        <li>Use a bowl, cup or whatever suits your sizing preference as a stencil to cut out round pieces of the flattened dough.<li>
        <li>Add two or three tablespoons of the meat filling to the center of each cutout, leaving about a half-inch space between the meat and the border of the crust. </li>
        <li>Take each patty to be and fold one end of the crust over the meat and seal it by crimping it with a fork.</li>
        <li>Place each patty on a baking sheet and and brush them with egg wash and then proceed to bake them for 30-35 minutes (Youll be able to tell they are finished when the the crust becomes golden with a little browning)</li>
